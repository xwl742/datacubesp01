        Context manager representing a database connection.

        If there is an active transaction for this index in the current thread, the connection object from that
        transaction is returned, with the active transaction remaining in control of commit and rollback.

        If there is no active transaction and the transaction argument is True, a new transactionised connection
        is returned, with this context manager handling commit and rollback.

        If there is no active transaction and the transaction argument is False (the default), a new connection
        is returned with autocommit semantics.

        Note that autocommit behaviour is NOT available if there is an active transaction for the index
        and the active thread.

        In Resource Manager code replace self._db.connect() with self.db_connection(), and replace
        self._db.begin() with self.db_connection(transaction=True).

        :param transaction: Use a transaction if one is not already active for the thread.
        :return: A PostgresDbAPI object, with the specified transaction semantics.
